Not all images make sense. Since generating them requires rebuild of the raster layer, I am going to collect the words with not so great images here and eventually replace them with better ones.

* 上游 - (shàng yóu) - upstream
* 系列 - (xì liè) - series
* 趋势 - (qū shì) - trend
* 比如 - (bǐ rú) - for example
* 鲜艳 - (xiān yàn) - bright
* 很 - (hěn) - very (i just don't like the image)
