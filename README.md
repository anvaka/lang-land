## Overview


HSK Land is an interactive map that visualizes Mandarin Chinese vocabulary, grouping similar words together
based on their meanings. It provides a unique way to explore and learn Chinese vocabulary by seeing connections
between related words. When you click on any word, you'll see:

- Word definitions
- Usage examples
- Character breakdowns
- Visual aids (when available)

Words that are semantically related are positioned closer together on the map, creating a "landscape of meaning"
that helps learners discover connections between concepts.

Clicking on a tile - is like discovering new land - it shows you both the flashcard, and an artistic image to 
memorize the word better. The map is designed to be both educational and visually appealing, making language learning
more fun.

I built this map for myself, and since I'm a novice Chinese learner, I used ChatGPT to generate the translation and
character breakdowns. Sometimes it makes mistakes, but this makes learning even more interesting! When you research
a mistake you learn more about the word. You can also help improve the map by submitting corrections
and suggestions through the GitHub repository (click on the link at the bottom of a flashcard).
